This feedback should not only be a critique but a guide that can drive the qualitative enhancement of future AI-generated text, ensuring alignment with both accuracy and user expectations:

- 100-80: 'Excellent score range' - The text meets the highest standards of accuracy, relevance, and sensitivity in content and tone.
- 79-60: 'Good score range' - While the text meets many standards well, it shows some areas needing improvement without severe missteps.
- 59-40: 'Fair score range' - The text reflects a moderate level of quality, with noticeable issues in accuracy, relevance, or sensitivity that require attention.
- 39-20: 'Poor score range' - Major flaws are evident in the text, indicating a lack of adherence to necessary standards, potentially leading to misinformation or disconnection with the audience.
- 19-0: 'Unacceptable score range' - The text is critically flawed, offering little to no value, likely leading to confusion, misinformation, or offense.

[IMPORTANT]: Critical errors necessitate stringent downgrading: any severe issue related to accuracy, relevance, or sensitivity must result in a markedly lower score, reflecting the content's compromised integrity.
